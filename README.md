# DESIGNING MAGICAL ARENA

# Magical Arena

The Magical Arena is a simple game where two players fight in an arena until one player's health reaches zero. Players attack in turns, rolling dice to determine the outcome of their attacks and defenses.

npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

## Game Rules

- Each player is defined by their "health," "strength," and "attack" attributes, all positive integers.
- The player dies if their health reaches zero.
- Players attack in turns, rolling a six-sided die to determine the outcome of their attacks and defenses.
- The attacker's attack value is multiplied by the outcome of their attacking die roll to calculate damage.
- The defender's strength value is multiplied by the outcome of their defending die roll to calculate the damage defended.
- The defender's health is reduced by the excess damage after defending.

## Implementation Details

- The project is implemented in Node.js.
- The Player class defines a player with attributes and methods for attacking and defending.
- The Game class manages the game flow, including starting the game and declaring a winner.
